# sassy-lanyon

This theme is a forked version of Mark Otto's [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. The aim is to make only two major changes to this simple and elegant theme:

1. Convert the CSS to SASS (actually SCSS) in a few separate files. This allows the theme user to use any colors or fonts that they desire.
2. Convert the theme into a Gem-based theme that can be added to a config.yml file and sourced as a gem instead of a repo on Github.

There are a few minor tweaks: I have added some booktabs-style table styling and relied on system fonts. All of thesse can be changed in the ```_settings.scss``` file and the ```tables.scss``` file in the ```scss``` directory. 

Other than than that, all of the original goodness of the theme is the same.

Since this is a forked version, do with it what you will as long as you respect the license on the original Lanyon theme.
