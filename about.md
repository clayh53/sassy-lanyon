In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

This is a test for the tweak of specifying GFM (Github-flavored Markdown) in the \_config.yml file.

First, a treble backtick code block:
```
#include <stdio.h>
main(void){}
  prints("Hello world\n");
  exit(1);
}
```

Now, a table in Markdown Extra:


| column 1| column 2 |column 3|
|:--------|:--------:|-------:|
| data    | 45.909   | &#$%   |
| something| another| the rest|
| data | or not | or maybe|
|Very long content block | followed by another|then short|
|23.8sdafsd9| \#asdfas | 9877.975%|
|garbage in| garbage out| supper |
|blah| loblaw| law blog|
|and on | and on| and on|
|it goes| it goes| it goes|
